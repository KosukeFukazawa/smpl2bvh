# smpl2bvh
This repository contains an example script to convert from a SMPL model to a bvh file.

The left side of the figure shows the SMPL grand truth and the right side shows the bvh data.

## Notification
This code is MIT licensed, but SMPL requires a separate license.  
Please see [SMPL official website](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/).

## Requirements
You need to download SMPL models in `./data/smpl/smpl/`.  
You need to download [smplx](https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx) too.  
To install from PyPi simply run:
```
    pip install smplx[all]
```

## How to use?
After downloads all requirements, you can use smpl2bvh like this:
```python
    python smpl2bvh.py --gender MALE --poses ${PATH_TO_Y0UR_INPUT} --fps 60 --output ${PATH_TO_SAVE} --mirror
```

`poses` is an `.npz` file or `.pkl` file.  
`.npz` file must contain `rotations` and `trans` as keys.  
`rotations` value is an np.array consisting of [fnum, 24, 3] and `trans` value is the root transition consisting of [fnum, 3]
(fnum means frame number).  

`.pkl` file must contain `smpl_poses` and `smpl_scaling` and `smpl_trans` as keys.  
`smpl_poses` value is an np.array consisting of [fnum, 72] and `smpl_scaling` value is the scaling parameter. `smpl_trans` value is the root transition consisting of [fnum, 3].  
The format of `pkl` file is the same as [AIST++](https://google.github.io/aistplusplus_dataset/) dataset.  
If you check `--mirror` as an argument, the mirrored motion is also saved.  
After processing, you can find bvh file as `--output`.  
For more information, please refer to `smpl2bvh.py`.  

## Reference
`bvh.py` and `quat.py` are based on [Motion Matching](https://github.com/orangeduck/Motion-Matching).
